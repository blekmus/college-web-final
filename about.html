      <p>Creating smiles for generations</p>
      <p>Nintendo's mission is to <b>put smiles on the faces of everyone we touch</b>. We do so by creating new
        surprises for people across the world to enjoy together. We've forged our own path since 1889, when we began
        making hanafuda playing cards in Kyoto, Japan. Today, weâ€™re fortunate to be able to share our characters, ideas
        and worlds through the medium of video games and the entertainment industry.
